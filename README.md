## Implementation Summary

### Completed Features
- **Sticky Navigation Header**
  - Responsive top navigation bar using Tailwind CSS.
  - Mobile hamburger menu with toggle functionality.
  - Smooth scrolling to sections when clicking navigation links.
  - Dynamic highlighting of the active section link.
  - Accessibility support: ARIA attributes, keyboard navigation, focus management.

- **Drag & Drop Demo**
  - Draggable list items that can be rearranged.
  - Two drop zones accepting items.
  - Styled with Tailwind CSS for a clean UI.

- **Blog List Demo**
  - Blog list with sorting (date, reading time, category).
  - Filtering by category.
  - Real-time search functionality.
  - Loading indicator and error display states.
  - Implemented with modular JavaScript (`BlogList.js`).

- **Styling**
  - Tailwind CSS integrated via CDN.
  - Additional custom CSS in `src/css/styles.css`.

### Pending Items
- Content for the "Navigation" section is placeholder only.
- Blog list currently uses static data â€” could be extended with API integration.
- Drag & Drop feature can be enhanced with animations and persistence.
- No automated testing suite implemented yet.

### Technical Challenges
- **Merge Conflicts**: Needed to resolve conflicts between `feature/drag-drop` and `feature/navigation` branches, especially in `main.js` and `index.html`.
- **Dynamic Navigation**: Ensuring the active nav link highlights correctly on scroll required Intersection Observer logic and careful DOM handling.
- **Responsiveness**: Adjusting the layout for both desktop and mobile required fine-tuning Tailwind classes and testing different breakpoints.
- **Accessibility**: Implementing ARIA roles and keyboard support to ensure usability beyond mouse interaction.

### AI Usage
- Used **ChatGPT (OpenAI)** as a coding assistant to:
  - Suggest code structure for modular JavaScript (`DragDrop.js`, `BlogList.js`, `navigation.js`).
  - Refactor sticky navigation with smooth scrolling and accessibility.
  - Generate Tailwind utility class combinations for responsive layouts.
  - Provide guidance on resolving Git merge conflicts.
  - Draft and refine project documentation (README).
